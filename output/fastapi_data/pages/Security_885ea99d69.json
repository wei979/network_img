  "content": "There are many ways to handle security, authentication and authorization.\n\nAnd it normally is a complex and \"difficult\" topic.\n\nIn many frameworks and systems just handling security and authentication takes a big amount of effort and code (in many cases it can be 50% or more of all the code written).\n\nFastAPI provides several tools to help you deal with Security easily, rapidly, in a standard way, without having to study and learn all the security specifications.\n\nBut first, let's check some small concepts.\n\nIf you don't care about any of these terms and you just need to add security with authentication based on username and password right now, skip to the next chapters.\n\nOAuth2 is a specification that defines several ways to handle authentication and authorization.\n\nIt is quite an extensive specification and covers several complex use cases.\n\nIt includes ways to authenticate using a \"third party\".\n\nThat's what all the systems with \"login with Facebook, Google, X (Twitter), GitHub\" use underneath.\n\nThere was an OAuth 1, which is very different from OAuth2, and more complex, as it included direct specifications on how to encrypt the communication.\n\nIt is not very popular or used nowadays.\n\nOAuth2 doesn't specify how to encrypt the communication, it expects you to have your application served with HTTPS.\n\nIn the section about deployment you will see how to set up HTTPS for free, using Traefik and Let's Encrypt.\n\nOpenID Connect is another specification, based on OAuth2.\n\nIt just extends OAuth2 specifying some things that are relatively ambiguous in OAuth2, to try to make it more interoperable.\n\nFor example, Google login uses OpenID Connect (which underneath uses OAuth2).\n\nBut Facebook login doesn't support OpenID Connect. It has its own flavor of OAuth2.\n\nThere was also an \"OpenID\" specification. That tried to solve the same thing as OpenID Connect, but was not based on OAuth2.\n\nSo, it was a complete additional system.\n\nIt is not very popular or used nowadays.\n\nOpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) is the open specification for building APIs (now part of the Linux Foundation).\n\nFastAPI is based on OpenAPI.\n\nThat's what makes it possible to have multiple automatic interactive documentation interfaces, code generation, etc.\n\nOpenAPI has a way to define multiple security \"schemes\".\n\nBy using them, you can take advantage of all these standard-based tools, including these interactive documentation systems.\n\nOpenAPI defines the following security schemes:\n\nIntegrating other authentication/authorization providers like Google, Facebook, X (Twitter), GitHub, etc. is also possible and relatively easy.\n\nThe most complex problem is building an authentication/authorization provider like those, but FastAPI gives you the tools to do it easily, while doing the heavy lifting for you.\n\nFastAPI provides several tools for each of these security schemes in the fastapi.security module that simplify using these security mechanisms.\n\nIn the next chapters you will see how to add security to your API using those tools provided by FastAPI.\n\nAnd you will also see how it gets automatically integrated into the interactive documentation system.",
