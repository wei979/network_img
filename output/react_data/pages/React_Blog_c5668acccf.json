  "content": "This blog is the official source for the updates from the React team. Anything important, including release notes or deprecation notices, will be posted here first.\n\nYou can also follow the @react.dev account on Bluesky, or @reactjs account on Twitter, but you won’t miss anything essential if you only read this blog.\n\nLast week we hosted React Conf 2025. In this post, we summarize the talks and announcements from the event…\n\nWe’re releasing the compiler’s first stable release today, plus linting and tooling improvements to make adoption easier.\n\nToday, we’re announcing our plans to create the React Foundation and a new technical governance structure …\n\nReact 19.2 adds new features like Activity, React Performance Tracks, useEffectEvent, and more. In this post …\n\nIn React Labs posts, we write about projects in active research and development. In this post, we’re sharing two new experimental features that are ready to try today, and sharing other areas we’re working on now …\n\nToday, we’re deprecating Create React App for new apps, and encouraging existing apps to migrate to a framework, or to migrate to a build tool like Vite, Parcel, or RSBuild. We’re also providing docs for when a framework isn’t a good fit for your project, you want to build your own framework, or you just want to learn how React works by building a React app from scratch …\n\nIn the React 19 Upgrade Guide, we shared step-by-step instructions for upgrading your app to React 19. In this post, we’ll give an overview of the new features in React 19, and how you can adopt them …\n\nWe announced an experimental release of React Compiler at React Conf 2024. We’ve made a lot of progress since then, and in this post we want to share what’s next for React Compiler …\n\nLast week we hosted React Conf 2024, a two-day conference in Henderson, Nevada where 700+ attendees gathered in-person to discuss the latest in UI engineering. This was our first in-person conference since 2019, and we were thrilled to be able to bring the community together again …\n\nThe improvements added to React 19 require some breaking changes, but we’ve worked to make the upgrade as smooth as possible, and we don’t expect the changes to impact most apps. In this post, we will guide you through the steps for upgrading libraries to React 19 …\n\nIn React Labs posts, we write about projects in active research and development. Since our last update, we’ve made significant progress on React Compiler, new features, and React 19, and we’d like to share what we learned.\n\nTraditionally, new React features used to only be available at Meta first, and land in the open source releases later. We’d like to offer the React community an option to adopt individual new features as soon as their design is close to final—similar to how Meta uses React internally. We are introducing a new officially supported Canary release channel. It lets curated setups like frameworks decouple adoption of individual React features from the React release schedule.\n\nIn React Labs posts, we write about projects in active research and development. Since our last update, we’ve made significant progress on React Server Components, Asset Loading, Optimizing Compiler, Offscreen Rendering, and Transition Tracing, and we’d like to share what we learned.\n\nToday we are thrilled to launch react.dev, the new home for React and its documentation. In this post, we would like to give you a tour of the new site.\n\nReact 18 was years in the making, and with it brought valuable lessons for the React team. Its release was the result of many years of research and exploring many paths. Some of those paths were successful; many more were dead-ends that led to new insights. One lesson we’ve learned is that it’s frustrating for the community to wait for new features without having insight into these paths that we’re exploring…\n\nReact 18 is now available on npm! In our last post, we shared step-by-step instructions for upgrading your app to React 18. In this post, we’ll give an overview of what’s new in React 18, and what it means for the future…\n\nAs we shared in the release post, React 18 introduces features powered by our new concurrent renderer, with a gradual adoption strategy for existing applications. In this post, we will guide you through the steps for upgrading to React 18…\n\nLast week we hosted our 6th React Conf. In previous years, we’ve used the React Conf stage to deliver industry changing announcements such as React Native and React Hooks. This year, we shared our multi-platform vision for React, starting with the release of React 18 and gradual adoption of concurrent features…\n\nThe React team is excited to share a few updates:\n\n2020 has been a long year. As it comes to an end we wanted to share a special Holiday Update on our research into zero-bundle-size React Server Components. To introduce React Server Components, we have prepared a talk and a demo. If you want, you can check them out during the holidays, or later when work picks back up in the new year…\n\nNot every React release deserves its own blog post, but you can find a detailed changelog for every release in the CHANGELOG.md file in the React repository, as well as on the Releases page.",
