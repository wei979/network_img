  "content": "Would you like to help FastAPI, other users, and the author?\n\nOr would you like to get help with FastAPI?\n\nThere are very simple ways to help (several involve just one or two clicks).\n\nAnd there are several ways to get help too.\n\nYou can subscribe to the (infrequent) FastAPI and friends newsletter to stay updated about:\n\nFollow @fastapi on X (Twitter) to get the latest news about FastAPI. 🐦\n\nYou can \"star\" FastAPI in GitHub (clicking the star button at the top right): https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi. ⭐️\n\nBy adding a star, other users will be able to find it more easily and see that it has been already useful for others.\n\nYou can \"watch\" FastAPI in GitHub (clicking the \"watch\" button at the top right): https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi. 👀\n\nThere you can select \"Releases only\".\n\nBy doing it, you will receive notifications (in your email) whenever there's a new release (a new version) of FastAPI with bug fixes and new features.\n\nYou can connect with me (Sebastián Ramírez / tiangolo), the author.\n\nTweet about FastAPI and let me and others know why you like it. 🎉\n\nI love to hear about how FastAPI is being used, what you have liked in it, in which project/company are you using it, etc.\n\nYou can try and help others with their questions in:\n\nIn many cases you might already know the answer for those questions. 🤓\n\nIf you are helping a lot of people with their questions, you will become an official FastAPI Expert. 🎉\n\nJust remember, the most important point is: try to be kind. People come with their frustrations and in many cases don't ask in the best way, but try as best as you can to be kind. 🤗\n\nThe idea is for the FastAPI community to be kind and welcoming. At the same time, don't accept bullying or disrespectful behavior towards others. We have to take care of each other.\n\nHere's how to help others with questions (in discussions or issues):\n\nCheck if you can understand what is the purpose and use case of the person asking.\n\nThen check if the question (the vast majority are questions) is clear.\n\nIn many cases the question asked is about an imaginary solution from the user, but there might be a better one. If you can understand the problem and use case better, you might be able to suggest a better alternative solution.\n\nIf you can't understand the question, ask for more details.\n\nFor most of the cases and most of the questions there's something related to the person's original code.\n\nIn many cases they will only copy a fragment of the code, but that's not enough to reproduce the problem.\n\nYou can ask them to provide a minimal, reproducible, example, that you can copy-paste and run locally to see the same error or behavior they are seeing, or to understand their use case better.\n\nIf you are feeling too generous, you can try to create an example like that yourself, just based on the description of the problem. Just keep in mind that this might take a lot of time and it might be better to ask them to clarify the problem first.\n\nAfter being able to understand the question, you can give them a possible answer.\n\nIn many cases, it's better to understand their underlying problem or use case, because there might be a better way to solve it than what they are trying to do.\n\nIf they reply, there's a high chance you would have solved their problem, congrats, you're a hero! 🦸\n\nNow, if that solved their problem, you can ask them to:\n\nYou can \"watch\" FastAPI in GitHub (clicking the \"watch\" button at the top right): https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi. 👀\n\nIf you select \"Watching\" instead of \"Releases only\" you will receive notifications when someone creates a new issue or question. You can also specify that you only want to be notified about new issues, or discussions, or PRs, etc.\n\nThen you can try and help them solve those questions.\n\nYou can create a new question in the GitHub repository, for example to:\n\nNote: if you do it, then I'm going to ask you to also help others. 😉\n\nYou can help me review pull requests from others.\n\nAgain, please try your best to be kind. 🤗\n\nHere's what to keep in mind and how to review a pull request:\n\nFirst, make sure you understand the problem that the pull request is trying to solve. It might have a longer discussion in a GitHub Discussion or issue.\n\nThere's also a good chance that the pull request is not actually needed because the problem can be solved in a different way. Then you can suggest or ask about that.\n\nDon't worry too much about things like commit message styles, I will squash and merge customizing the commit manually.\n\nAlso don't worry about style rules, there are already automatized tools checking that.\n\nAnd if there's any other style or consistency need, I'll ask directly for that, or I'll add commits on top with the needed changes.\n\nCheck and read the code, see if it makes sense, run it locally and see if it actually solves the problem.\n\nThen comment saying that you did that, that's how I will know you really checked it.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't simply trust PRs that just have several approvals.\n\nSeveral times it has happened that there are PRs with 3, 5 or more approvals, probably because the description is appealing, but when I check the PRs, they are actually broken, have a bug, or don't solve the problem they claim to solve. 😅\n\nSo, it's really important that you actually read and run the code, and let me know in the comments that you did. 🤓\n\nHelp me check that the PR has tests.\n\nCheck that the tests fail before the PR. 🚨\n\nThen check that the tests pass after the PR. ✅\n\nMany PRs don't have tests, you can remind them to add tests, or you can even suggest some tests yourself. That's one of the things that consume most time and you can help a lot with that.\n\nThen also comment what you tried, that way I'll know that you checked it. 🤓\n\nYou can contribute to the source code with Pull Requests, for example:\n\nHelp me maintain FastAPI! 🤓\n\nThere's a lot of work to do, and for most of it, YOU can do it.\n\nThe main tasks that you can do right now are:\n\nThose two tasks are what consume time the most. That's the main work of maintaining FastAPI.\n\nIf you can help me with that, you are helping me maintain FastAPI and making sure it keeps advancing faster and better. 🚀\n\nJoin the 👥 Discord chat server 👥 and hang out with others in the FastAPI community.\n\nFor questions, ask them in GitHub Discussions, there's a much better chance you will receive help by the FastAPI Experts.\n\nUse the chat only for other general conversations.\n\nKeep in mind that as chats allow more \"free conversation\", it's easy to ask questions that are too general and more difficult to answer, so, you might not receive answers.\n\nIn GitHub, the template will guide you to write the right question so that you can more easily get a good answer, or even solve the problem yourself even before asking. And in GitHub I can make sure I always answer everything, even if it takes some time. I can't personally do that with the chat systems. 😅\n\nConversations in the chat systems are also not as easily searchable as in GitHub, so questions and answers might get lost in the conversation. And only the ones in GitHub count to become a FastAPI Expert, so you will most probably receive more attention in GitHub.\n\nOn the other side, there are thousands of users in the chat systems, so there's a high chance you'll find someone to talk to there, almost all the time. 😄\n\nIf your product/company depends on or is related to FastAPI and you want to reach its users, you can sponsor the author (me) through GitHub sponsors. Depending on the tier, you could get some extra benefits, like a badge in the docs. 🎁",
