  "content": "React development is led by a dedicated team working full time at Meta. It also receives contributions from people all over the world.\n\nThe React Core team members work full time on the core component APIs, the engine that powers React DOM and React Native, React DevTools, and the React documentation website.\n\nCurrent members of the React team are listed in alphabetical order below.\n\nAndrew got started with web development by making sites with WordPress, and eventually tricked himself into doing JavaScript. His favorite pastime is karaoke. Andrew is either a Disney villain or a Disney princess, depending on the day.\n\nDan got into programming after he accidentally discovered Visual Basic inside Microsoft PowerPoint. He has found his true calling in turning Sebastian’s tweets into long-form blog posts. Dan occasionally wins at Fortnite by hiding in a bush until the game ends.\n\nEli got into programming after he got suspended from middle school for hacking. He has been working on React and React Native since 2017. He enjoys eating treats, especially ice cream and apple pie. You can find Eli trying quirky activities like parkour, indoor skydiving, and aerial silks.\n\nHendrik’s journey in tech started in the late 90s when he built his first websites with Netscape Communicator. After earning a diploma in computer science and working at digital agencies, he built a React Server Components bundler and library, paving the way to his role on the Next.js team. Outside of work, he enjoys cycling and tinkering in his workshop.\n\nShortly after being introduced to AutoHotkey, Jack had written scripts to automate everything he could think of. When reaching limitations there, he dove headfirst into web app development and hasn’t looked back. Most recently, Jack worked on the web platform at Instagram before moving to React. His favorite programming language is JSX.\n\nJason abandoned embedded C for a career in front-end engineering and never looked back. Armed with esoteric CSS knowledge and a passion for beautiful UI, Jason joined Facebook in 2010, where he now feels privileged to have seen JavaScript development come of age. Though he may not understand how for...of loops work, he loves getting to work with brilliant people on projects that enable amazing UX.\n\nJoe was planning to major in math and philosophy but got into computer science after writing physics simulations in Matlab. Prior to React, he worked on Relay, RSocket.js, and the Skip programming language. While he’s not building some sort of reactive system he enjoys running, studying Japanese, and spending time with his family.\n\nJordan started coding by building iPhone apps, where he was pushing and popping view controllers before he knew that for-loops were a thing. He enjoys working on technology that developers love, which naturally drew him to React. Outside of work he enjoys reading, kiteboarding, and playing guitar.\n\nJosh majored in Mathematics and discovered programming while in college. His first professional developer job was to program insurance rate calculations in Microsoft Excel, the paragon of Reactive Programming which must be why he now works on React. In between that time Josh has been an IC, Manager, and Executive at a few startups. outside of work he likes to push his limits with cooking.\n\nLauren’s programming career peaked when she first discovered the <marquee> tag. She’s been chasing that high ever since. She studied Finance instead of CS in college, so she learned to code using Excel. Lauren enjoys dropping cheeky memes in chat, playing video games with her partner, learning Korean, and petting her dog Zelda.\n\nMatt stumbled into coding, and since then, has become enamored with creating things in communities that can’t be created alone. Prior to React, he worked on YouTube, the Google Assistant, Fuchsia, and Google Cloud AI and Evernote. When he’s not trying to make better developer tools he enjoys the mountains, jazz, and spending time with his family.\n\nMike went to grad school dreaming of becoming a professor but realized that he liked building things a lot more than writing grant applications. Mike joined Meta to work on Javascript infrastructure, which ultimately led him to work on the React Compiler. When not hacking on either Javascript or OCaml, Mike can often be found hiking or skiing in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nMofei started programming when she realized it can help her cheat in video games. She focused on operating systems in undergrad / grad school, but now finds herself happily tinkering on React. Outside of work, she enjoys debugging bouldering problems and planning her next backpacking trip(s).\n\nPieter studied building science but after failing to get a job he made himself a website and things escalated from there. At Meta, he enjoys working on performance, languages and now React. When he’s not programming you can find him off-road in the mountains.\n\nRicky majored in theoretical math and somehow found himself on the React Native team for a couple years before joining the React team. When he’s not programming you can find him snowboarding, biking, climbing, golfing, or closing GitHub issues that do not match the issue template.\n\nRuslan’s introduction to UI programming started when he was a kid by manually editing HTML templates for his custom gaming forums. Somehow, he ended up majoring in Computer Science. He enjoys music, games, and memes. Mostly memes.\n\nSebastian majored in psychology. He’s usually quiet. Even when he says something, it often doesn’t make sense to the rest of us until a few months later. The correct way to pronounce his surname is “mark-boa-geh” but he settled for “mark-beige” out of pragmatism — and that’s how he approaches React.\n\nSebastian learned programming to make the browser games he played during class more enjoyable. Eventually this lead to contributing to as much open source code as possible. Outside of coding he’s busy making sure people don’t confuse him with the other Sebastians and Zilberman of the React community.\n\nSeth started programming as a kid growing up in Tucson, AZ. After school, he was bitten by the music bug and was a touring musician for about 10 years before returning to work, starting with Intuit. In his spare time, he loves taking pictures and flying for animal rescues in the northeastern United States.\n\nFour days after React was released, Sophie rewrote the entirety of her then-current project to use it, which she now realizes was perhaps a bit reckless. After she became the project’s #1 committer, she wondered why she wasn’t getting paid by Facebook like everyone else was and joined the team officially to lead React through its adolescent years. Though she quit that job years ago, somehow she’s still in the team’s group chats and “providing value”.\n\nYuzhi studied Computer Science in school. She liked the instant gratification of seeing code come to life without having to physically be in a laboratory. Now she’s a manager in the React org. Before management, she used to work on the Relay data fetching framework. In her spare time, Yuzhi enjoys optimizing her life via gardening and home improvement projects.\n\nYou can find the past team members and other people who significantly contributed to React over the years on the acknowledgements page.",
