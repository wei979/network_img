  "content": "You can use OAuth2 scopes directly with FastAPI, they are integrated to work seamlessly.\n\nThis would allow you to have a more fine-grained permission system, following the OAuth2 standard, integrated into your OpenAPI application (and the API docs).\n\nOAuth2 with scopes is the mechanism used by many big authentication providers, like Facebook, Google, GitHub, Microsoft, X (Twitter), etc. They use it to provide specific permissions to users and applications.\n\nEvery time you \"log in with\" Facebook, Google, GitHub, Microsoft, X (Twitter), that application is using OAuth2 with scopes.\n\nIn this section you will see how to manage authentication and authorization with the same OAuth2 with scopes in your FastAPI application.\n\nThis is a more or less advanced section. If you are just starting, you can skip it.\n\nYou don't necessarily need OAuth2 scopes, and you can handle authentication and authorization however you want.\n\nBut OAuth2 with scopes can be nicely integrated into your API (with OpenAPI) and your API docs.\n\nNevertheless, you still enforce those scopes, or any other security/authorization requirement, however you need, in your code.\n\nIn many cases, OAuth2 with scopes can be an overkill.\n\nBut if you know you need it, or you are curious, keep reading.\n\nThe OAuth2 specification defines \"scopes\" as a list of strings separated by spaces.\n\nThe content of each of these strings can have any format, but should not contain spaces.\n\nThese scopes represent \"permissions\".\n\nIn OpenAPI (e.g. the API docs), you can define \"security schemes\".\n\nWhen one of these security schemes uses OAuth2, you can also declare and use scopes.\n\nEach \"scope\" is just a string (without spaces).\n\nThey are normally used to declare specific security permissions, for example:\n\nIn OAuth2 a \"scope\" is just a string that declares a specific permission required.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it has other characters like : or if it is a URL.\n\nThose details are implementation specific.\n\nFor OAuth2 they are just strings.\n\nFirst, let's quickly see the parts that change from the examples in the main Tutorial - User Guide for OAuth2 with Password (and hashing), Bearer with JWT tokens. Now using OAuth2 scopes:\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nNow let's review those changes step by step.\n\nThe first change is that now we are declaring the OAuth2 security scheme with two available scopes, me and items.\n\nThe scopes parameter receives a dict with each scope as a key and the description as the value:\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nBecause we are now declaring those scopes, they will show up in the API docs when you log-in/authorize.\n\nAnd you will be able to select which scopes you want to give access to: me and items.\n\nThis is the same mechanism used when you give permissions while logging in with Facebook, Google, GitHub, etc:\n\nNow, modify the token path operation to return the scopes requested.\n\nWe are still using the same OAuth2PasswordRequestForm. It includes a property scopes with a list of str, with each scope it received in the request.\n\nAnd we return the scopes as part of the JWT token.\n\nFor simplicity, here we are just adding the scopes received directly to the token.\n\nBut in your application, for security, you should make sure you only add the scopes that the user is actually able to have, or the ones you have predefined.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nNow we declare that the path operation for /users/me/items/ requires the scope items.\n\nFor this, we import and use Security from fastapi.\n\nYou can use Security to declare dependencies (just like Depends), but Security also receives a parameter scopes with a list of scopes (strings).\n\nIn this case, we pass a dependency function get_current_active_user to Security (the same way we would do with Depends).\n\nBut we also pass a list of scopes, in this case with just one scope: items (it could have more).\n\nAnd the dependency function get_current_active_user can also declare sub-dependencies, not only with Depends but also with Security. Declaring its own sub-dependency function (get_current_user), and more scope requirements.\n\nIn this case, it requires the scope me (it could require more than one scope).\n\nYou don't necessarily need to add different scopes in different places.\n\nWe are doing it here to demonstrate how FastAPI handles scopes declared at different levels.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nSecurity is actually a subclass of Depends, and it has just one extra parameter that we'll see later.\n\nBut by using Security instead of Depends, FastAPI will know that it can declare security scopes, use them internally, and document the API with OpenAPI.\n\nBut when you import Query, Path, Depends, Security and others from fastapi, those are actually functions that return special classes.\n\nNow update the dependency get_current_user.\n\nThis is the one used by the dependencies above.\n\nHere's where we are using the same OAuth2 scheme we created before, declaring it as a dependency: oauth2_scheme.\n\nBecause this dependency function doesn't have any scope requirements itself, we can use Depends with oauth2_scheme, we don't have to use Security when we don't need to specify security scopes.\n\nWe also declare a special parameter of type SecurityScopes, imported from fastapi.security.\n\nThis SecurityScopes class is similar to Request (Request was used to get the request object directly).\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nThe parameter security_scopes will be of type SecurityScopes.\n\nIt will have a property scopes with a list containing all the scopes required by itself and all the dependencies that use this as a sub-dependency. That means, all the \"dependants\"... this might sound confusing, it is explained again later below.\n\nThe security_scopes object (of class SecurityScopes) also provides a scope_str attribute with a single string, containing those scopes separated by spaces (we are going to use it).\n\nWe create an HTTPException that we can reuse (raise) later at several points.\n\nIn this exception, we include the scopes required (if any) as a string separated by spaces (using scope_str). We put that string containing the scopes in the WWW-Authenticate header (this is part of the spec).\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nWe verify that we get a username, and extract the scopes.\n\nAnd then we validate that data with the Pydantic model (catching the ValidationError exception), and if we get an error reading the JWT token or validating the data with Pydantic, we raise the HTTPException we created before.\n\nFor that, we update the Pydantic model TokenData with a new property scopes.\n\nBy validating the data with Pydantic we can make sure that we have, for example, exactly a list of str with the scopes and a str with the username.\n\nInstead of, for example, a dict, or something else, as it could break the application at some point later, making it a security risk.\n\nWe also verify that we have a user with that username, and if not, we raise that same exception we created before.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nWe now verify that all the scopes required, by this dependency and all the dependants (including path operations), are included in the scopes provided in the token received, otherwise raise an HTTPException.\n\nFor this, we use security_scopes.scopes, that contains a list with all these scopes as str.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nLet's review again this dependency tree and the scopes.\n\nAs the get_current_active_user dependency has as a sub-dependency on get_current_user, the scope \"me\" declared at get_current_active_user will be included in the list of required scopes in the security_scopes.scopes passed to get_current_user.\n\nThe path operation itself also declares a scope, \"items\", so this will also be in the list of security_scopes.scopes passed to get_current_user.\n\nHere's how the hierarchy of dependencies and scopes looks like:\n\nThe important and \"magic\" thing here is that get_current_user will have a different list of scopes to check for each path operation.\n\nAll depending on the scopes declared in each path operation and each dependency in the dependency tree for that specific path operation.\n\nYou can use SecurityScopes at any point, and in multiple places, it doesn't have to be at the \"root\" dependency.\n\nIt will always have the security scopes declared in the current Security dependencies and all the dependants for that specific path operation and that specific dependency tree.\n\nBecause the SecurityScopes will have all the scopes declared by dependants, you can use it to verify that a token has the required scopes in a central dependency function, and then declare different scope requirements in different path operations.\n\nThey will be checked independently for each path operation.\n\nIf you open the API docs, you can authenticate and specify which scopes you want to authorize.\n\nIf you don't select any scope, you will be \"authenticated\", but when you try to access /users/me/ or /users/me/items/ you will get an error saying that you don't have enough permissions. You will still be able to access /status/.\n\nAnd if you select the scope me but not the scope items, you will be able to access /users/me/ but not /users/me/items/.\n\nThat's what would happen to a third party application that tried to access one of these path operations with a token provided by a user, depending on how many permissions the user gave the application.\n\nIn this example we are using the OAuth2 \"password\" flow.\n\nThis is appropriate when we are logging in to our own application, probably with our own frontend.\n\nBecause we can trust it to receive the username and password, as we control it.\n\nBut if you are building an OAuth2 application that others would connect to (i.e., if you are building an authentication provider equivalent to Facebook, Google, GitHub, etc.) you should use one of the other flows.\n\nThe most common is the implicit flow.\n\nThe most secure is the code flow, but it's more complex to implement as it requires more steps. As it is more complex, many providers end up suggesting the implicit flow.\n\nIt's common that each authentication provider names their flows in a different way, to make it part of their brand.\n\nBut in the end, they are implementing the same OAuth2 standard.\n\nFastAPI includes utilities for all these OAuth2 authentication flows in fastapi.security.oauth2.\n\nThe same way you can define a list of Depends in the decorator's dependencies parameter (as explained in Dependencies in path operation decorators), you could also use Security with scopes there.",
