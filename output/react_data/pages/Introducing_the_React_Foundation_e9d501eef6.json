  "content": "October 7, 2025 by Seth Webster, Matt Carroll, Joe Savona, Sophie Alpert\n\nToday, we’re announcing our plans to create the React Foundation and a new technical governance structure.\n\nWe open sourced React over a decade ago to help developers build great user experiences. From its earliest days, React has received substantial contributions from contributors outside of Meta. Over time, the number of contributors and the scope of their contributions has grown significantly. What started out as a tool developed for Meta has expanded into a project that spans multiple companies with regular contributions from across the ecosystem. React has outgrown the confines of any one company.\n\nTo better serve the React community, we are announcing our plans to move React and React Native from Meta to a new React Foundation. As a part of this change, we will also be implementing a new independent technical governance structure. We believe these changes will enable us to give React ecosystem projects more resources.\n\nWe will make the React Foundation the new home for React, React Native, and some supporting projects like JSX. The React Foundation’s mission will be to support the React community and ecosystem. Once implemented, the React Foundation will\n\nThe React Foundation will be governed by a board of directors, with Seth Webster serving as the executive director. This board will direct funds and resources to support React’s development, community, and ecosystem. We believe that this is the best structure to ensure that the React Foundation is vendor-neutral and reflects the best interests of the community.\n\nThe founding corporate members of the React Foundation will be Amazon, Callstack, Expo, Meta, Microsoft, Software Mansion, and Vercel. These companies have had a major impact on the React and React Native ecosystems and we are grateful for their support. We are excited to welcome even more members in the future.\n\nWe believe that React’s technical direction should be set by the people who contribute to and maintain React. As React moves to a foundation, it is important that no single company or organization is overrepresented. To achieve this, we plan to define a new technical governance structure for React that is independent from the React Foundation.\n\nAs a part of creating React’s new technical governance structure we will reach out to the community for feedback. Once finalized, we will share details in a future post.\n\nReact’s incredible growth is thanks to the thousands of people, companies, and projects that have shaped React. The creation of the React Foundation is a testament to the strength and vibrancy of the React community. Together, the React Foundation and React’s new technical governance will ensure that React’s future is secure for years to come.",
