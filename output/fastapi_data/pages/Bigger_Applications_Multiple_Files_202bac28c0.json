  "content": "If you are building an application or a web API, it's rarely the case that you can put everything in a single file.\n\nFastAPI provides a convenience tool to structure your application while keeping all the flexibility.\n\nIf you come from Flask, this would be the equivalent of Flask's Blueprints.\n\nLet's say you have a file structure like this:\n\nThere are several __init__.py files: one in each directory or subdirectory.\n\nThis is what allows importing code from one file into another.\n\nFor example, in app/main.py you could have a line like:\n\nThe same file structure with comments:\n\nLet's say the file dedicated to handling just users is the submodule at /app/routers/users.py.\n\nYou want to have the path operations related to your users separated from the rest of the code, to keep it organized.\n\nBut it's still part of the same FastAPI application/web API (it's part of the same \"Python Package\").\n\nYou can create the path operations for that module using APIRouter.\n\nYou import it and create an \"instance\" the same way you would with the class FastAPI:\n\nAnd then you use it to declare your path operations.\n\nUse it the same way you would use the FastAPI class:\n\nYou can think of APIRouter as a \"mini FastAPI\" class.\n\nAll the same options are supported.\n\nAll the same parameters, responses, dependencies, tags, etc.\n\nIn this example, the variable is called router, but you can name it however you want.\n\nWe are going to include this APIRouter in the main FastAPI app, but first, let's check the dependencies and another APIRouter.\n\nWe see that we are going to need some dependencies used in several places of the application.\n\nSo we put them in their own dependencies module (app/dependencies.py).\n\nWe will now use a simple dependency to read a custom X-Token header:\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nWe are using an invented header to simplify this example.\n\nBut in real cases you will get better results using the integrated Security utilities.\n\nLet's say you also have the endpoints dedicated to handling \"items\" from your application in the module at app/routers/items.py.\n\nYou have path operations for:\n\nIt's all the same structure as with app/routers/users.py.\n\nBut we want to be smarter and simplify the code a bit.\n\nWe know all the path operations in this module have the same:\n\nSo, instead of adding all that to each path operation, we can add it to the APIRouter.\n\nAs the path of each path operation has to start with /, like in:\n\n...the prefix must not include a final /.\n\nSo, the prefix in this case is /items.\n\nWe can also add a list of tags and extra responses that will be applied to all the path operations included in this router.\n\nAnd we can add a list of dependencies that will be added to all the path operations in the router and will be executed/solved for each request made to them.\n\nNote that, much like dependencies in path operation decorators, no value will be passed to your path operation function.\n\nThe end result is that the item paths are now:\n\nHaving dependencies in the APIRouter can be used, for example, to require authentication for a whole group of path operations. Even if the dependencies are not added individually to each one of them.\n\nThe prefix, tags, responses, and dependencies parameters are (as in many other cases) just a feature from FastAPI to help you avoid code duplication.\n\nThis code lives in the module app.routers.items, the file app/routers/items.py.\n\nAnd we need to get the dependency function from the module app.dependencies, the file app/dependencies.py.\n\nSo we use a relative import with .. for the dependencies:\n\nIf you know perfectly how imports work, continue to the next section below.\n\nA single dot ., like in:\n\nBut that file doesn't exist, our dependencies are in a file at app/dependencies.py.\n\nRemember how our app/file structure looks like:\n\nThe two dots .., like in:\n\nThat works correctly! 🎉\n\nThe same way, if we had used three dots ..., like in:\n\nThat would refer to some package above app/, with its own file __init__.py, etc. But we don't have that. So, that would throw an error in our example. 🚨\n\nBut now you know how it works, so you can use relative imports in your own apps no matter how complex they are. 🤓\n\nWe are not adding the prefix /items nor the tags=[\"items\"] to each path operation because we added them to the APIRouter.\n\nBut we can still add more tags that will be applied to a specific path operation, and also some extra responses specific to that path operation:\n\nThis last path operation will have the combination of tags: [\"items\", \"custom\"].\n\nAnd it will also have both responses in the documentation, one for 404 and one for 403.\n\nNow, let's see the module at app/main.py.\n\nHere's where you import and use the class FastAPI.\n\nThis will be the main file in your application that ties everything together.\n\nAnd as most of your logic will now live in its own specific module, the main file will be quite simple.\n\nYou import and create a FastAPI class as normally.\n\nAnd we can even declare global dependencies that will be combined with the dependencies for each APIRouter:\n\nNow we import the other submodules that have APIRouters:\n\nAs the files app/routers/users.py and app/routers/items.py are submodules that are part of the same Python package app, we can use a single dot . to import them using \"relative imports\".\n\nThe module items will have a variable router (items.router). This is the same one we created in the file app/routers/items.py, it's an APIRouter object.\n\nAnd then we do the same for the module users.\n\nWe could also import them like:\n\nThe first version is a \"relative import\":\n\nThe second version is an \"absolute import\":\n\nTo learn more about Python Packages and Modules, read the official Python documentation about Modules.\n\nWe are importing the submodule items directly, instead of importing just its variable router.\n\nThis is because we also have another variable named router in the submodule users.\n\nIf we had imported one after the other, like:\n\nthe router from users would overwrite the one from items and we wouldn't be able to use them at the same time.\n\nSo, to be able to use both of them in the same file, we import the submodules directly:\n\nNow, let's include the routers from the submodules users and items:\n\nusers.router contains the APIRouter inside of the file app/routers/users.py.\n\nAnd items.router contains the APIRouter inside of the file app/routers/items.py.\n\nWith app.include_router() we can add each APIRouter to the main FastAPI application.\n\nIt will include all the routes from that router as part of it.\n\nIt will actually internally create a path operation for each path operation that was declared in the APIRouter.\n\nSo, behind the scenes, it will actually work as if everything was the same single app.\n\nYou don't have to worry about performance when including routers.\n\nThis will take microseconds and will only happen at startup.\n\nSo it won't affect performance. ⚡\n\nNow, let's imagine your organization gave you the app/internal/admin.py file.\n\nIt contains an APIRouter with some admin path operations that your organization shares between several projects.\n\nFor this example it will be super simple. But let's say that because it is shared with other projects in the organization, we cannot modify it and add a prefix, dependencies, tags, etc. directly to the APIRouter:\n\nBut we still want to set a custom prefix when including the APIRouter so that all its path operations start with /admin, we want to secure it with the dependencies we already have for this project, and we want to include tags and responses.\n\nWe can declare all that without having to modify the original APIRouter by passing those parameters to app.include_router():\n\nThat way, the original APIRouter will stay unmodified, so we can still share that same app/internal/admin.py file with other projects in the organization.\n\nThe result is that in our app, each of the path operations from the admin module will have:\n\nBut that will only affect that APIRouter in our app, not in any other code that uses it.\n\nSo, for example, other projects could use the same APIRouter with a different authentication method.\n\nWe can also add path operations directly to the FastAPI app.\n\nHere we do it... just to show that we can 🤷:\n\nand it will work correctly, together with all the other path operations added with app.include_router().\n\nVery Technical Details\n\nNote: this is a very technical detail that you probably can just skip.\n\nThe APIRouters are not \"mounted\", they are not isolated from the rest of the application.\n\nThis is because we want to include their path operations in the OpenAPI schema and the user interfaces.\n\nAs we cannot just isolate them and \"mount\" them independently of the rest, the path operations are \"cloned\" (re-created), not included directly.\n\nAnd open the docs at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.\n\nYou will see the automatic API docs, including the paths from all the submodules, using the correct paths (and prefixes) and the correct tags:\n\nYou can also use .include_router() multiple times with the same router using different prefixes.\n\nThis could be useful, for example, to expose the same API under different prefixes, e.g. /api/v1 and /api/latest.\n\nThis is an advanced usage that you might not really need, but it's there in case you do.\n\nThe same way you can include an APIRouter in a FastAPI application, you can include an APIRouter in another APIRouter using:\n\nMake sure you do it before including router in the FastAPI app, so that the path operations from other_router are also included.",
