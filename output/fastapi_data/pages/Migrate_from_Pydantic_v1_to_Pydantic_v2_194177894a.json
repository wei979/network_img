  "title": "Migrate from Pydantic v1 to Pydantic v2¶",
  "content": "If you have an old FastAPI app, you might be using Pydantic version 1.\n\nFastAPI has had support for either Pydantic v1 or v2 since version 0.100.0.\n\nIf you had installed Pydantic v2, it would use it. If instead you had Pydantic v1, it would use that.\n\nPydantic v1 is now deprecated and support for it will be removed in the next versions of FastAPI, you should migrate to Pydantic v2. This way you will get the latest features, improvements, and fixes.\n\nAlso, the Pydantic team stopped support for Pydantic v1 for the latest versions of Python, starting with Python 3.14.\n\nIf you want to use the latest features of Python, you will need to make sure you use Pydantic v2.\n\nIf you have an old FastAPI app with Pydantic v1, here I'll show you how to migrate it to Pydantic v2, and the new features in FastAPI 0.119.0 to help you with a gradual migration.\n\nPydantic has an official Migration Guide from v1 to v2.\n\nIt also includes what has changed, how validations are now more correct and strict, possible caveats, etc.\n\nYou can read it to understand better what has changed.\n\nMake sure you have tests for your app and you run them on continuous integration (CI).\n\nThis way, you can do the upgrade and make sure everything is still working as expected.\n\nIn many cases, when you use regular Pydantic models without customizations, you will be able to automate most of the process of migrating from Pydantic v1 to Pydantic v2.\n\nYou can use bump-pydantic from the same Pydantic team.\n\nThis tool will help you to automatically change most of the code that needs to be changed.\n\nAfter this, you can run the tests and check if everything works. If it does, you are done. 😎\n\nPydantic v2 includes everything from Pydantic v1 as a submodule pydantic.v1.\n\nThis means that you can install the latest version of Pydantic v2 and import and use the old Pydantic v1 components from this submodule, as if you had the old Pydantic v1 installed.\n\nSince FastAPI 0.119.0, there's also partial support for Pydantic v1 from inside of Pydantic v2, to facilitate the migration to v2.\n\nSo, you could upgrade Pydantic to the latest version 2, and change the imports to use the pydantic.v1 submodule, and in many cases it would just work.\n\nHave in mind that as the Pydantic team no longer supports Pydantic v1 in recent versions of Python, starting from Python 3.14, using pydantic.v1 is also not supported in Python 3.14 and above.\n\nIt's not supported by Pydantic to have a model of Pydantic v2 with its own fields defined as Pydantic v1 models or vice versa.\n\n...but, you can have separated models using Pydantic v1 and v2 in the same app.\n\nIn some cases, it's even possible to have both Pydantic v1 and v2 models in the same path operation in your FastAPI app:\n\nIn this example above, the input model is a Pydantic v1 model, and the output model (defined in response_model=ItemV2) is a Pydantic v2 model.\n\nIf you need to use some of the FastAPI-specific tools for parameters like Body, Query, Form, etc. with Pydantic v1 models, you can import them from fastapi.temp_pydantic_v1_params while you finish the migration to Pydantic v2:\n\nFirst try with bump-pydantic, if your tests pass and that works, then you're done in one command. ✨\n\nIf bump-pydantic doesn't work for your use case, you can use the support for both Pydantic v1 and v2 models in the same app to do the migration to Pydantic v2 gradually.\n\nYou could fist upgrade Pydantic to use the latest version 2, and change the imports to use pydantic.v1 for all your models.\n\nThen, you can start migrating your models from Pydantic v1 to v2 in groups, in gradual steps. 🚶",
