  "content": "FastAPI doesn't require you to use a SQL (relational) database. But you can use any database that you want.\n\nHere we'll see an example using SQLModel.\n\nSQLModel is built on top of SQLAlchemy and Pydantic. It was made by the same author of FastAPI to be the perfect match for FastAPI applications that need to use SQL databases.\n\nYou could use any other SQL or NoSQL database library you want (in some cases called \"ORMs\"), FastAPI doesn't force you to use anything. 😎\n\nAs SQLModel is based on SQLAlchemy, you can easily use any database supported by SQLAlchemy (which makes them also supported by SQLModel), like:\n\nIn this example, we'll use SQLite, because it uses a single file and Python has integrated support. So, you can copy this example and run it as is.\n\nLater, for your production application, you might want to use a database server like PostgreSQL.\n\nThere is an official project generator with FastAPI and PostgreSQL including a frontend and more tools: https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template\n\nThis is a very simple and short tutorial, if you want to learn about databases in general, about SQL, or more advanced features, go to the SQLModel docs.\n\nFirst, make sure you create your virtual environment, activate it, and then install sqlmodel:\n\nWe'll create the simplest first version of the app with a single SQLModel model first.\n\nLater we'll improve it increasing security and versatility with multiple models below. 🤓\n\nImport SQLModel and create a database model:\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nThe Hero class is very similar to a Pydantic model (in fact, underneath, it actually is a Pydantic model).\n\nThere are a few differences:\n\ntable=True tells SQLModel that this is a table model, it should represent a table in the SQL database, it's not just a data model (as would be any other regular Pydantic class).\n\nField(primary_key=True) tells SQLModel that the id is the primary key in the SQL database (you can learn more about SQL primary keys in the SQLModel docs).\n\nBy having the type as int | None, SQLModel will know that this column should be an INTEGER in the SQL database and that it should be NULLABLE.\n\nField(index=True) tells SQLModel that it should create a SQL index for this column, that would allow faster lookups in the database when reading data filtered by this column.\n\nSQLModel will know that something declared as str will be a SQL column of type TEXT (or VARCHAR, depending on the database).\n\nA SQLModel engine (underneath it's actually a SQLAlchemy engine) is what holds the connections to the database.\n\nYou would have one single engine object for all your code to connect to the same database.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nUsing check_same_thread=False allows FastAPI to use the same SQLite database in different threads. This is necessary as one single request could use more than one thread (for example in dependencies).\n\nDon't worry, with the way the code is structured, we'll make sure we use a single SQLModel session per request later, this is actually what the check_same_thread is trying to achieve.\n\nWe then add a function that uses SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine) to create the tables for all the table models.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nA Session is what stores the objects in memory and keeps track of any changes needed in the data, then it uses the engine to communicate with the database.\n\nWe will create a FastAPI dependency with yield that will provide a new Session for each request. This is what ensures that we use a single session per request. 🤓\n\nThen we create an Annotated dependency SessionDep to simplify the rest of the code that will use this dependency.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nWe will create the database tables when the application starts.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nHere we create the tables on an application startup event.\n\nFor production you would probably use a migration script that runs before you start your app. 🤓\n\nSQLModel will have migration utilities wrapping Alembic, but for now, you can use Alembic directly.\n\nBecause each SQLModel model is also a Pydantic model, you can use it in the same type annotations that you could use Pydantic models.\n\nFor example, if you declare a parameter of type Hero, it will be read from the JSON body.\n\nThe same way, you can declare it as the function's return type, and then the shape of the data will show up in the automatic API docs UI.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nHere we use the SessionDep dependency (a Session) to add the new Hero to the Session instance, commit the changes to the database, refresh the data in the hero, and then return it.\n\nWe can read Heros from the database using a select(). We can include a limit and offset to paginate the results.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nWe can read a single Hero.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nWe can also delete a Hero.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nThen go to the /docs UI, you will see that FastAPI is using these models to document the API, and it will use them to serialize and validate the data too.\n\nNow let's refactor this app a bit to increase security and versatility.\n\nIf you check the previous app, in the UI you can see that, up to now, it lets the client decide the id of the Hero to create. 😱\n\nWe shouldn't let that happen, they could overwrite an id we already have assigned in the DB. Deciding the id should be done by the backend or the database, not by the client.\n\nAdditionally, we create a secret_name for the hero, but so far, we are returning it everywhere, that's not very secret... 😅\n\nWe'll fix these things by adding a few extra models. Here's where SQLModel will shine. ✨\n\nIn SQLModel, any model class that has table=True is a table model.\n\nAnd any model class that doesn't have table=True is a data model, these ones are actually just Pydantic models (with a couple of small extra features). 🤓\n\nWith SQLModel, we can use inheritance to avoid duplicating all the fields in all the cases.\n\nLet's start with a HeroBase model that has all the fields that are shared by all the models:\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nThen let's create Hero, the actual table model, with the extra fields that are not always in the other models:\n\nBecause Hero inherits form HeroBase, it also has the fields declared in HeroBase, so all the fields for Hero are:\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nNext, we create a HeroPublic model, this is the one that will be returned to the clients of the API.\n\nIt has the same fields as HeroBase, so it won't include secret_name.\n\nFinally, the identity of our heroes is protected! 🥷\n\nIt also re-declares id: int. By doing this, we are making a contract with the API clients, so that they can always expect the id to be there and to be an int (it will never be None).\n\nHaving the return model ensure that a value is always available and always int (not None) is very useful for the API clients, they can write much simpler code having this certainty.\n\nAlso, automatically generated clients will have simpler interfaces, so that the developers communicating with your API can have a much better time working with your API. 😎\n\nAll the fields in HeroPublic are the same as in HeroBase, with id declared as int (not None):\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nNow we create a HeroCreate model, this is the one that will validate the data from the clients.\n\nIt has the same fields as HeroBase, and it also has secret_name.\n\nNow, when the clients create a new hero, they will send the secret_name, it will be stored in the database, but those secret names won't be returned in the API to the clients.\n\nThis is how you would handle passwords. Receive them, but don't return them in the API.\n\nYou would also hash the values of the passwords before storing them, never store them in plain text.\n\nThe fields of HeroCreate are:\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nWe didn't have a way to update a hero in the previous version of the app, but now with multiple models, we can do it. 🎉\n\nThe HeroUpdate data model is somewhat special, it has all the same fields that would be needed to create a new hero, but all the fields are optional (they all have a default value). This way, when you update a hero, you can send just the fields that you want to update.\n\nBecause all the fields actually change (the type now includes None and they now have a default value of None), we need to re-declare them.\n\nWe don't really need to inherit from HeroBase because we are re-declaring all the fields. I'll leave it inheriting just for consistency, but this is not necessary. It's more a matter of personal taste. 🤷\n\nThe fields of HeroUpdate are:\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nNow that we have multiple models, we can update the parts of the app that use them.\n\nWe receive in the request a HeroCreate data model, and from it, we create a Hero table model.\n\nThis new table model Hero will have the fields sent by the client, and will also have an id generated by the database.\n\nThen we return the same table model Hero as is from the function. But as we declare the response_model with the HeroPublic data model, FastAPI will use HeroPublic to validate and serialize the data.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nNow we use response_model=HeroPublic instead of the return type annotation -> HeroPublic because the value that we are returning is actually not a HeroPublic.\n\nIf we had declared -> HeroPublic, your editor and linter would complain (rightfully so) that you are returning a Hero instead of a HeroPublic.\n\nBy declaring it in response_model we are telling FastAPI to do its thing, without interfering with the type annotations and the help from your editor and other tools.\n\nWe can do the same as before to read Heros, again, we use response_model=list[HeroPublic] to ensure that the data is validated and serialized correctly.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nWe can read a single hero:\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nWe can update a hero. For this we use an HTTP PATCH operation.\n\nAnd in the code, we get a dict with all the data sent by the client, only the data sent by the client, excluding any values that would be there just for being the default values. To do it we use exclude_unset=True. This is the main trick. 🪄\n\nThen we use hero_db.sqlmodel_update(hero_data) to update the hero_db with the data from hero_data.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nDeleting a hero stays pretty much the same.\n\nWe won't satisfy the desire to refactor everything in this one. 😅\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nYou can run the app again:\n\nIf you go to the /docs API UI, you will see that it is now updated, and it won't expect to receive the id from the client when creating a hero, etc.\n\nYou can use SQLModel to interact with a SQL database and simplify the code with data models and table models.\n\nYou can learn a lot more at the SQLModel docs, there's a longer mini tutorial on using SQLModel with FastAPI. 🚀",
