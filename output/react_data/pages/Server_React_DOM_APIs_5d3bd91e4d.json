  "content": "The react-dom/server APIs let you server-side render React components to HTML. These APIs are only used on the server at the top level of your app to generate the initial HTML. A framework may call them for you. Most of your components don’t need to import or use them.\n\nThese methods are only available in the environments with Web Streams, which includes browsers, Deno, and some modern edge runtimes:\n\nNode.js also includes these methods for compatibility, but they are not recommended due to worse performance. Use the dedicated Node.js APIs instead.\n\nThese methods are only available in the environments with Node.js Streams:\n\nThese methods can be used in the environments that don’t support streams:\n\nThey have limited functionality compared to the streaming APIs.",
