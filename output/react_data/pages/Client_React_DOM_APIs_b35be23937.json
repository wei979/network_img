  "content": "The react-dom/client APIs let you render React components on the client (in the browser). These APIs are typically used at the top level of your app to initialize your React tree. A framework may call them for you. Most of your components don’t need to import or use them.\n\nReact supports all popular browsers, including Internet Explorer 9 and above. Some polyfills are required for older browsers such as IE 9 and IE 10.",
