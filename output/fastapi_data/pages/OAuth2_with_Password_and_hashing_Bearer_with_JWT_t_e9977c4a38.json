  "content": "Now that we have all the security flow, let's make the application actually secure, using JWT tokens and secure password hashing.\n\nThis code is something you can actually use in your application, save the password hashes in your database, etc.\n\nWe are going to start from where we left in the previous chapter and increment it.\n\nJWT means \"JSON Web Tokens\".\n\nIt's a standard to codify a JSON object in a long dense string without spaces. It looks like this:\n\nIt is not encrypted, so, anyone could recover the information from the contents.\n\nBut it's signed. So, when you receive a token that you emitted, you can verify that you actually emitted it.\n\nThat way, you can create a token with an expiration of, let's say, 1 week. And then when the user comes back the next day with the token, you know that user is still logged in to your system.\n\nAfter a week, the token will be expired and the user will not be authorized and will have to sign in again to get a new token. And if the user (or a third party) tried to modify the token to change the expiration, you would be able to discover it, because the signatures would not match.\n\nIf you want to play with JWT tokens and see how they work, check https://jwt.io.\n\nWe need to install PyJWT to generate and verify the JWT tokens in Python.\n\nMake sure you create a virtual environment, activate it, and then install pyjwt:\n\nIf you are planning to use digital signature algorithms like RSA or ECDSA, you should install the cryptography library dependency pyjwt[crypto].\n\nYou can read more about it in the PyJWT Installation docs.\n\n\"Hashing\" means converting some content (a password in this case) into a sequence of bytes (just a string) that looks like gibberish.\n\nWhenever you pass exactly the same content (exactly the same password) you get exactly the same gibberish.\n\nBut you cannot convert from the gibberish back to the password.\n\nIf your database is stolen, the thief won't have your users' plaintext passwords, only the hashes.\n\nSo, the thief won't be able to try to use that password in another system (as many users use the same password everywhere, this would be dangerous).\n\npwdlib is a great Python package to handle password hashes.\n\nIt supports many secure hashing algorithms and utilities to work with them.\n\nThe recommended algorithm is \"Argon2\".\n\nMake sure you create a virtual environment, activate it, and then install pwdlib with Argon2:\n\nWith pwdlib, you could even configure it to be able to read passwords created by Django, a Flask security plug-in or many others.\n\nSo, you would be able to, for example, share the same data from a Django application in a database with a FastAPI application. Or gradually migrate a Django application using the same database.\n\nAnd your users would be able to login from your Django app or from your FastAPI app, at the same time.\n\nImport the tools we need from pwdlib.\n\nCreate a PasswordHash instance with recommended settings - it will be used for hashing and verifying passwords.\n\npwdlib also supports the bcrypt hashing algorithm but does not include legacy algorithms - for working with outdated hashes, it is recommended to use the passlib library.\n\nFor example, you could use it to read and verify passwords generated by another system (like Django) but hash any new passwords with a different algorithm like Argon2 or Bcrypt.\n\nAnd be compatible with all of them at the same time.\n\nCreate a utility function to hash a password coming from the user.\n\nAnd another utility to verify if a received password matches the hash stored.\n\nAnd another one to authenticate and return a user.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nIf you check the new (fake) database fake_users_db, you will see how the hashed password looks like now: \"$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$wagCPXjifgvUFBzq4hqe3w$CYaIb8sB+wtD+Vu/P4uod1+Qof8h+1g7bbDlBID48Rc\".\n\nImport the modules installed.\n\nCreate a random secret key that will be used to sign the JWT tokens.\n\nTo generate a secure random secret key use the command:\n\nAnd copy the output to the variable SECRET_KEY (don't use the one in the example).\n\nCreate a variable ALGORITHM with the algorithm used to sign the JWT token and set it to \"HS256\".\n\nCreate a variable for the expiration of the token.\n\nDefine a Pydantic Model that will be used in the token endpoint for the response.\n\nCreate a utility function to generate a new access token.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nUpdate get_current_user to receive the same token as before, but this time, using JWT tokens.\n\nDecode the received token, verify it, and return the current user.\n\nIf the token is invalid, return an HTTP error right away.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nCreate a timedelta with the expiration time of the token.\n\nCreate a real JWT access token and return it.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nPrefer to use the Annotated version if possible.\n\nThe JWT specification says that there's a key sub, with the subject of the token.\n\nIt's optional to use it, but that's where you would put the user's identification, so we are using it here.\n\nJWT might be used for other things apart from identifying a user and allowing them to perform operations directly on your API.\n\nFor example, you could identify a \"car\" or a \"blog post\".\n\nThen you could add permissions about that entity, like \"drive\" (for the car) or \"edit\" (for the blog).\n\nAnd then, you could give that JWT token to a user (or bot), and they could use it to perform those actions (drive the car, or edit the blog post) without even needing to have an account, just with the JWT token your API generated for that.\n\nUsing these ideas, JWT can be used for way more sophisticated scenarios.\n\nIn those cases, several of those entities could have the same ID, let's say foo (a user foo, a car foo, and a blog post foo).\n\nSo, to avoid ID collisions, when creating the JWT token for the user, you could prefix the value of the sub key, e.g. with username:. So, in this example, the value of sub could have been: username:johndoe.\n\nThe important thing to keep in mind is that the sub key should have a unique identifier across the entire application, and it should be a string.\n\nRun the server and go to the docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.\n\nYou'll see the user interface like:\n\nAuthorize the application the same way as before.\n\nUsing the credentials:\n\nUsername: johndoe Password: secret\n\nNotice that nowhere in the code is the plaintext password \"secret\", we only have the hashed version.\n\nCall the endpoint /users/me/, you will get the response as:\n\nIf you open the developer tools, you could see how the data sent only includes the token, the password is only sent in the first request to authenticate the user and get that access token, but not afterwards:\n\nNotice the header Authorization, with a value that starts with Bearer.\n\nOAuth2 has the notion of \"scopes\".\n\nYou can use them to add a specific set of permissions to a JWT token.\n\nThen you can give this token to a user directly or a third party, to interact with your API with a set of restrictions.\n\nYou can learn how to use them and how they are integrated into FastAPI later in the Advanced User Guide.\n\nWith what you have seen up to now, you can set up a secure FastAPI application using standards like OAuth2 and JWT.\n\nIn almost any framework handling the security becomes a rather complex subject quite quickly.\n\nMany packages that simplify it a lot have to make many compromises with the data model, database, and available features. And some of these packages that simplify things too much actually have security flaws underneath.\n\nFastAPI doesn't make any compromise with any database, data model or tool.\n\nIt gives you all the flexibility to choose the ones that fit your project the best.\n\nAnd you can use directly many well maintained and widely used packages like pwdlib and PyJWT, because FastAPI doesn't require any complex mechanisms to integrate external packages.\n\nBut it provides you the tools to simplify the process as much as possible without compromising flexibility, robustness, or security.\n\nAnd you can use and implement secure, standard protocols, like OAuth2 in a relatively simple way.\n\nYou can learn more in the Advanced User Guide about how to use OAuth2 \"scopes\", for a more fine-grained permission system, following these same standards. OAuth2 with scopes is the mechanism used by many big authentication providers, like Facebook, Google, GitHub, Microsoft, X (Twitter), etc. to authorize third party applications to interact with their APIs on behalf of their users.",
