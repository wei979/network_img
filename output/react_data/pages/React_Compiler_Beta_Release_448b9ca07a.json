  "content": "October 21, 2024 by Lauren Tan.\n\nPlease see the stable release blog post for details.\n\nThe React team is excited to share new updates:\n\nAt React Conf 2024, we announced the experimental release of React Compiler, a build-time tool that optimizes your React app through automatic memoization. You can find an introduction to React Compiler here.\n\nSince the first release, we’ve fixed numerous bugs reported by the React community, received several high quality bug fixes and contributions1 to the compiler, made the compiler more resilient to the broad diversity of JavaScript patterns, and have continued to roll out the compiler more widely at Meta.\n\nIn this post, we want to share what’s next for React Compiler.\n\nAt React India 2024, we shared an update on React Compiler. Today, we are excited to announce a new Beta release of React Compiler and ESLint plugin. New betas are published to npm using the @beta tag.\n\nTo install React Compiler Beta:\n\nOr, if you’re using Yarn:\n\nYou can watch Sathya Gunasekaran’s talk at React India here:\n\nReact Compiler’s ESLint plugin helps developers proactively identify and correct Rules of React violations. We strongly recommend everyone use the linter today. The linter does not require that you have the compiler installed, so you can use it independently, even if you are not ready to try out the compiler.\n\nTo install the linter only:\n\nOr, if you’re using Yarn:\n\nAfter installation you can enable the linter by adding it to your ESLint config. Using the linter helps identify Rules of React breakages, making it easier to adopt the compiler when it’s fully released.\n\nReact Compiler produces code that depends on runtime APIs added in React 19, but we’ve since added support for the compiler to also work with React 17 and 18. If you are not on React 19 yet, in the Beta release you can now try out React Compiler by specifying a minimum target in your compiler config, and adding react-compiler-runtime as a dependency. You can find docs on this here.\n\nOur initial release was focused on identifying major issues with using the compiler in applications. We’ve gotten great feedback and have substantially improved the compiler since then. We’re now ready for broad feedback from the community, and for library authors to try out the compiler to improve performance and the developer experience of maintaining your library.\n\nReact Compiler can also be used to compile libraries. Because React Compiler needs to run on the original source code prior to any code transformations, it is not possible for an application’s build pipeline to compile the libraries they use. Hence, our recommendation is for library maintainers to independently compile and test their libraries with the compiler, and ship compiled code to npm.\n\nBecause your code is pre-compiled, users of your library will not need to have the compiler enabled in order to benefit from the automatic memoization applied to your library. If your library targets apps not yet on React 19, specify a minimum target and add react-compiler-runtime as a direct dependency. The runtime package will use the correct implementation of APIs depending on the application’s version, and polyfill the missing APIs if necessary.\n\nYou can find more docs on this here.\n\nWe previously announced the invite-only React Compiler Working Group at React Conf to provide feedback, ask questions, and collaborate on the compiler’s experimental release.\n\nFrom today, together with the Beta release of React Compiler, we are opening up Working Group membership to everyone. The goal of the React Compiler Working Group is to prepare the ecosystem for a smooth, gradual adoption of React Compiler by existing applications and libraries. Please continue to file bug reports in the React repo, but please leave feedback, ask questions, or share ideas in the Working Group discussion forum.\n\nThe core team will also use the discussions repo to share our research findings. As the Stable Release gets closer, any important information will also be posted on this forum.\n\nAt React Conf, we shared that our rollout of the compiler on Quest Store and Instagram were successful. Since then, we’ve deployed React Compiler across several more major web apps at Meta, including Facebook and Threads. That means if you’ve used any of these apps recently, you may have had your experience powered by the compiler. We were able to onboard these apps onto the compiler with few code changes required, in a monorepo with more than 100,000 React components.\n\nWe’ve seen notable performance improvements across all of these apps. As we’ve rolled out, we’re continuing to see results on the order of the wins we shared previously at ReactConf. These apps have already been heavily hand tuned and optimized by Meta engineers and React experts over the years, so even improvements on the order of a few percent are a huge win for us.\n\nWe also expected developer productivity wins from React Compiler. To measure this, we collaborated with our data science partners at Meta2 to conduct a thorough statistical analysis of the impact of manual memoization on productivity. Before rolling out the compiler at Meta, we discovered that only about 8% of React pull requests used manual memoization and that these pull requests took 31-46% longer to author3. This confirmed our intuition that manual memoization introduces cognitive overhead, and we anticipate that React Compiler will lead to more efficient code authoring and review. Notably, React Compiler also ensures that all code is memoized by default, not just the (in our case) 8% where developers explicitly apply memoization.\n\nThis is not a final roadmap, and is subject to change.\n\nWe intend to ship a Release Candidate of the compiler in the near future following the Beta release, when the majority of apps and libraries that follow the Rules of React have been proven to work well with the compiler. After a period of final feedback from the community, we plan on a Stable Release for the compiler. The Stable Release will mark the beginning of a new foundation for React, and all apps and libraries will be strongly recommended to use the compiler and ESLint plugin.\n\nThese releases also include the compiler’s ESLint plugin, which surfaces diagnostics statically analyzed by the compiler. We plan to combine the existing eslint-plugin-react-hooks plugin with the compiler’s ESLint plugin, so only one plugin needs to be installed.\n\nPost-Stable, we plan to add more compiler optimizations and improvements. This includes both continual improvements to automatic memoization, and new optimizations altogether, with minimal to no change of product code. Upgrading to each new release of the compiler is aimed to be straightforward, and each upgrade will continue to improve performance and add better handling of diverse JavaScript and React patterns.\n\nThroughout this process, we also plan to prototype an IDE extension for React. It is still very early in research, so we expect to be able to share more of our findings with you in a future React Labs blog post.\n\nThanks to Sathya Gunasekaran, Joe Savona, Ricky Hanlon, Alex Taylor, Jason Bonta, and Eli White for reviewing and editing this post.\n\nThanks @nikeee, @henryqdineen, @TrickyPi, and several others for their contributions to the compiler. ↩\n\nThanks Vaishali Garg for leading this study on React Compiler at Meta, and for reviewing this post. ↩\n\nAfter controlling on author tenure, diff length/complexity, and other potential confounding factors. ↩",
