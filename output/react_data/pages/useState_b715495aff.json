  "content": "useState is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component.\n\nCall useState at the top level of your component to declare a state variable.\n\nThe convention is to name state variables like [something, setSomething] using array destructuring.\n\nSee more examples below.\n\nuseState returns an array with exactly two values:\n\nThe set function returned by useState lets you update the state to a different value and trigger a re-render. You can pass the next state directly, or a function that calculates it from the previous state:\n\nset functions do not have a return value.\n\nThe set function only updates the state variable for the next render. If you read the state variable after calling the set function, you will still get the old value that was on the screen before your call.\n\nIf the new value you provide is identical to the current state, as determined by an Object.is comparison, React will skip re-rendering the component and its children. This is an optimization. Although in some cases React may still need to call your component before skipping the children, it shouldn’t affect your code.\n\nReact batches state updates. It updates the screen after all the event handlers have run and have called their set functions. This prevents multiple re-renders during a single event. In the rare case that you need to force React to update the screen earlier, for example to access the DOM, you can use flushSync.\n\nThe set function has a stable identity, so you will often see it omitted from Effect dependencies, but including it will not cause the Effect to fire. If the linter lets you omit a dependency without errors, it is safe to do. Learn more about removing Effect dependencies.\n\nCalling the set function during rendering is only allowed from within the currently rendering component. React will discard its output and immediately attempt to render it again with the new state. This pattern is rarely needed, but you can use it to store information from the previous renders. See an example below.\n\nIn Strict Mode, React will call your updater function twice in order to help you find accidental impurities. This is development-only behavior and does not affect production. If your updater function is pure (as it should be), this should not affect the behavior. The result from one of the calls will be ignored.\n\nCall useState at the top level of your component to declare one or more state variables.\n\nThe convention is to name state variables like [something, setSomething] using array destructuring.\n\nuseState returns an array with exactly two items:\n\nTo update what’s on the screen, call the set function with some next state:\n\nReact will store the next state, render your component again with the new values, and update the UI.\n\nCalling the set function does not change the current state in the already executing code:\n\nIt only affects what useState will return starting from the next render.\n\nIn this example, the count state variable holds a number. Clicking the button increments it.\n\nSuppose the age is 42. This handler calls setAge(age + 1) three times:\n\nHowever, after one click, age will only be 43 rather than 45! This is because calling the set function does not update the age state variable in the already running code. So each setAge(age + 1) call becomes setAge(43).\n\nTo solve this problem, you may pass an updater function to setAge instead of the next state:\n\nHere, a => a + 1 is your updater function. It takes the pending state and calculates the next state from it.\n\nReact puts your updater functions in a queue. Then, during the next render, it will call them in the same order:\n\nThere are no other queued updates, so React will store 45 as the current state in the end.\n\nBy convention, it’s common to name the pending state argument for the first letter of the state variable name, like a for age. However, you may also call it like prevAge or something else that you find clearer.\n\nReact may call your updaters twice in development to verify that they are pure.\n\nYou might hear a recommendation to always write code like setAge(a => a + 1) if the state you’re setting is calculated from the previous state. There is no harm in it, but it is also not always necessary.\n\nIn most cases, there is no difference between these two approaches. React always makes sure that for intentional user actions, like clicks, the age state variable would be updated before the next click. This means there is no risk of a click handler seeing a “stale” age at the beginning of the event handler.\n\nHowever, if you do multiple updates within the same event, updaters can be helpful. They’re also helpful if accessing the state variable itself is inconvenient (you might run into this when optimizing re-renders).\n\nIf you prefer consistency over slightly more verbose syntax, it’s reasonable to always write an updater if the state you’re setting is calculated from the previous state. If it’s calculated from the previous state of some other state variable, you might want to combine them into one object and use a reducer.\n\nThis example passes the updater function, so the “+3” button works.\n\nYou can put objects and arrays into state. In React, state is considered read-only, so you should replace it rather than mutate your existing objects. For example, if you have a form object in state, don’t mutate it:\n\nInstead, replace the whole object by creating a new one:\n\nRead updating objects in state and updating arrays in state to learn more.\n\nIn this example, the form state variable holds an object. Each input has a change handler that calls setForm with the next state of the entire form. The { ...form } spread syntax ensures that the state object is replaced rather than mutated.\n\nReact saves the initial state once and ignores it on the next renders.\n\nAlthough the result of createInitialTodos() is only used for the initial render, you’re still calling this function on every render. This can be wasteful if it’s creating large arrays or performing expensive calculations.\n\nTo solve this, you may pass it as an initializer function to useState instead:\n\nNotice that you’re passing createInitialTodos, which is the function itself, and not createInitialTodos(), which is the result of calling it. If you pass a function to useState, React will only call it during initialization.\n\nReact may call your initializers twice in development to verify that they are pure.\n\nThis example passes the initializer function, so the createInitialTodos function only runs during initialization. It does not run when component re-renders, such as when you type into the input.\n\nYou’ll often encounter the key attribute when rendering lists. However, it also serves another purpose.\n\nYou can reset a component’s state by passing a different key to a component. In this example, the Reset button changes the version state variable, which we pass as a key to the Form. When the key changes, React re-creates the Form component (and all of its children) from scratch, so its state gets reset.\n\nRead preserving and resetting state to learn more.\n\nUsually, you will update state in event handlers. However, in rare cases you might want to adjust state in response to rendering — for example, you might want to change a state variable when a prop changes.\n\nIn most cases, you don’t need this:\n\nIn the rare case that none of these apply, there is a pattern you can use to update state based on the values that have been rendered so far, by calling a set function while your component is rendering.\n\nHere’s an example. This CountLabel component displays the count prop passed to it:\n\nSay you want to show whether the counter has increased or decreased since the last change. The count prop doesn’t tell you this — you need to keep track of its previous value. Add the prevCount state variable to track it. Add another state variable called trend to hold whether the count has increased or decreased. Compare prevCount with count, and if they’re not equal, update both prevCount and trend. Now you can show both the current count prop and how it has changed since the last render.\n\nNote that if you call a set function while rendering, it must be inside a condition like prevCount !== count, and there must be a call like setPrevCount(count) inside of the condition. Otherwise, your component would re-render in a loop until it crashes. Also, you can only update the state of the currently rendering component like this. Calling the set function of another component during rendering is an error. Finally, your set call should still update state without mutation — this doesn’t mean you can break other rules of pure functions.\n\nThis pattern can be hard to understand and is usually best avoided. However, it’s better than updating state in an effect. When you call the set function during render, React will re-render that component immediately after your component exits with a return statement, and before rendering the children. This way, children don’t need to render twice. The rest of your component function will still execute (and the result will be thrown away). If your condition is below all the Hook calls, you may add an early return; to restart rendering earlier.\n\nCalling the set function does not change state in the running code:\n\nThis is because states behaves like a snapshot. Updating state requests another render with the new state value, but does not affect the count JavaScript variable in your already-running event handler.\n\nIf you need to use the next state, you can save it in a variable before passing it to the set function:\n\nReact will ignore your update if the next state is equal to the previous state, as determined by an Object.is comparison. This usually happens when you change an object or an array in state directly:\n\nYou mutated an existing obj object and passed it back to setObj, so React ignored the update. To fix this, you need to ensure that you’re always replacing objects and arrays in state instead of mutating them:\n\nYou might get an error that says: Too many re-renders. React limits the number of renders to prevent an infinite loop. Typically, this means that you’re unconditionally setting state during render, so your component enters a loop: render, set state (which causes a render), render, set state (which causes a render), and so on. Very often, this is caused by a mistake in specifying an event handler:\n\nIf you can’t find the cause of this error, click on the arrow next to the error in the console and look through the JavaScript stack to find the specific set function call responsible for the error.\n\nIn Strict Mode, React will call some of your functions twice instead of once:\n\nThis is expected and shouldn’t break your code.\n\nThis development-only behavior helps you keep components pure. React uses the result of one of the calls, and ignores the result of the other call. As long as your component, initializer, and updater functions are pure, this shouldn’t affect your logic. However, if they are accidentally impure, this helps you notice the mistakes.\n\nFor example, this impure updater function mutates an array in state:\n\nBecause React calls your updater function twice, you’ll see the todo was added twice, so you’ll know that there is a mistake. In this example, you can fix the mistake by replacing the array instead of mutating it:\n\nNow that this updater function is pure, calling it an extra time doesn’t make a difference in behavior. This is why React calling it twice helps you find mistakes. Only component, initializer, and updater functions need to be pure. Event handlers don’t need to be pure, so React will never call your event handlers twice.\n\nRead keeping components pure to learn more.\n\nYou can’t put a function into state like this:\n\nBecause you’re passing a function, React assumes that someFunction is an initializer function, and that someOtherFunction is an updater function, so it tries to call them and store the result. To actually store a function, you have to put () => before them in both cases. Then React will store the functions you pass.",
