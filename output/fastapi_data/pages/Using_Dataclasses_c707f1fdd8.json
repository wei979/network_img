  "content": "FastAPI is built on top of Pydantic, and I have been showing you how to use Pydantic models to declare requests and responses.\n\nBut FastAPI also supports using dataclasses the same way:\n\nThis is still supported thanks to Pydantic, as it has internal support for dataclasses.\n\nSo, even with the code above that doesn't use Pydantic explicitly, FastAPI is using Pydantic to convert those standard dataclasses to Pydantic's own flavor of dataclasses.\n\nAnd of course, it supports the same:\n\nThis works the same way as with Pydantic models. And it is actually achieved in the same way underneath, using Pydantic.\n\nKeep in mind that dataclasses can't do everything Pydantic models can do.\n\nSo, you might still need to use Pydantic models.\n\nBut if you have a bunch of dataclasses laying around, this is a nice trick to use them to power a web API using FastAPI. 🤓\n\nYou can also use dataclasses in the response_model parameter:\n\nThe dataclass will be automatically converted to a Pydantic dataclass.\n\nThis way, its schema will show up in the API docs user interface:\n\nYou can also combine dataclasses with other type annotations to make nested data structures.\n\nIn some cases, you might still have to use Pydantic's version of dataclasses. For example, if you have errors with the automatically generated API documentation.\n\nIn that case, you can simply swap the standard dataclasses with pydantic.dataclasses, which is a drop-in replacement:\n\nWe still import field from standard dataclasses.\n\npydantic.dataclasses is a drop-in replacement for dataclasses.\n\nThe Author dataclass includes a list of Item dataclasses.\n\nThe Author dataclass is used as the response_model parameter.\n\nYou can use other standard type annotations with dataclasses as the request body.\n\nIn this case, it's a list of Item dataclasses.\n\nHere we are returning a dictionary that contains items which is a list of dataclasses.\n\nFastAPI is still capable of serializing the data to JSON.\n\nHere the response_model is using a type annotation of a list of Author dataclasses.\n\nAgain, you can combine dataclasses with standard type annotations.\n\nNotice that this path operation function uses regular def instead of async def.\n\nAs always, in FastAPI you can combine def and async def as needed.\n\nIf you need a refresher about when to use which, check out the section \"In a hurry?\" in the docs about async and await.\n\nThis path operation function is not returning dataclasses (although it could), but a list of dictionaries with internal data.\n\nFastAPI will use the response_model parameter (that includes dataclasses) to convert the response.\n\nYou can combine dataclasses with other type annotations in many different combinations to form complex data structures.\n\nCheck the in-code annotation tips above to see more specific details.\n\nYou can also combine dataclasses with other Pydantic models, inherit from them, include them in your own models, etc.\n\nTo learn more, check the Pydantic docs about dataclasses.\n\nThis is available since FastAPI version 0.67.0. 🔖",
